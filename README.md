## Introduction

Chat Nova is a full-stack chatbot that allows you to build a custom AI chatbot with full authentication and database management flow in a just few minutes. It is built with React, Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Setup environment variables

1. Create `env.local` file inside the root directory of the project, and add the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY= <YOUR API KEY HERE>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL= <SUPABASE URL>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= <ANON KEY>
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY= <SERVICE KEY>
   ```
2. Generate a new OpenAI API key: [OpenAI Docs](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).

3. Generate Supabase API keys, and service key: [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-nextjs#get-the-api-keys).

## Setup Supabase Database

Once you have successfully setup the environment variables, you can now setup the Supabase database. Follow these steps:

### Users Table

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor, and run the following SQL query to create the users table:

   ```sql
   create table
     public.users (
       id uuid not null,
       created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
       email text not null,
       avatar_url text null,
       role text not null default 'user'::text,
       constraint users_pkey primary key (id),
       constraint users_id_fkey foreign key (id) references auth.users (id) on update cascade on    delete cascade
     ) tablespace pg_default;
    ```

2. Create PostgreSQL Function to create user:

   ```sql
   create function public.create_profile_for_user()
   returns trigger
   language plpgsql
   security definer set search_path = public
   as $$
   begin
       insert into public.users (id, email, avatar_url)
       values (
         new.id,
         new.raw_user_meta_data->'email',
         new.raw_user_meta_data->'avatar_url'
       );
       return new;
   end;
   $$;
   ```

3. Create PostgreSQL Trigger to create profile:

   ```sql
   create trigger on_auth_user_created
     after insert on auth.users
     for each row execute procedure public.create_profile_for_user();
   ```

### Chats Table

Open Supabase SQL Editor, and run the following SQL query to create the chats table:

```sql
create table
  public.chats (
    id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    user_id uuid not null,
    title text null,
    constraint chats_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint chats_user_id_fkey foreign key (user_id) references users (id) on update cascade on delete cascade
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

Once you create the chats table, you need to create the necessary RLS policies for this table. ( What is RLS? [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) )

1. authenticated users can create new chats:

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "authenticated users can create new chats" ON "public"."chats"
   AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT
   TO authenticated

   WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid())
   ```   

2. authenticated users can delete their own chat:

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "authenticated users can delete their own chat" ON "public"."chats"
   AS PERMISSIVE FOR DELETE
   TO authenticated
   USING (user_id = auth.uid())
   ```  

3. authenticated users can update their own chats:

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "authenticated users can update their own chats" ON "public"."chats"
   AS PERMISSIVE FOR UPDATE
   TO authenticated
   USING (user_id = auth.uid())
   WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid())
   ```   

3. authenticated users can view their own chats:

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "authenticated users can view their own chats" ON "public"."chats"
   AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT
   TO authenticated
   USING (user_id = auth.uid())
   ```   

### Messages Table

Open Supabase SQL Editor, and run the following SQL query to create the messages table:

```sql
create table
  public.messages (
    id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    role text not null,
    content text not null,
    chat_id uuid not null,
    user_id uuid not null,
    constraint messages_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint messages_chat_id_fkey foreign key (chat_id) references chats (id) on update cascade on delete cascade,
    constraint messages_user_id_fkey foreign key (user_id) references users (id) on update cascade on delete cascade
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

Once you create the messages table, you need to create the necessary RLS policies for this table. ( What is RLS? [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) )

1. enable insert messages for authenticated users only:

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "enable insert for authenticated users only" ON "public"."messages"
   AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT
   TO authenticated
  
   WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid())
   ```   

2. users can view their own messages:

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "users can view their own messages" ON "public"."messages"
   AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT
   TO authenticated
   USING (user_id = auth.uid())
   ```  

### Documents Table

Open Supabase SQL Editor, and run the following SQL query to create the `vector` extenstion and the documents table:

```sql
-- Create the 'vector' extension
create extension if not exists vector;

-- Create a function to search for documents
create function match_documents (
  query_embedding vector (1536),
  match_count int default null,
  filter jsonb default '{}'
) returns table (
  id bigint,
  content text,
  metadata jsonb,
  embedding jsonb,
  similarity float
) language plpgsql as $$
#variable_conflict use_column
begin
  return query
  select
    id,
    content,
    metadata,
    (embedding::text)::jsonb as embedding,
    1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  from documents
  where metadata @> filter
  order by documents.embedding <=> query_embedding
  limit match_count;
end;
$$;
```

Once you create the documents table, you need to create the necessary RLS policies for this table. ( What is RLS? [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) )

1. enable insert documents:

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "enable insert documents" ON "public"."documents"
   AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT
   TO public

   WITH CHECK (true)
   ```   

2. enable read access for all users:

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "enable read access for all users" ON "public"."documents"
   AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT
   TO public
   USING (true)
   ```

Now you have successfully setup the Supabase database. You can now run the project locally.
